# Titanic Classification

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Exploration
- Explore the Titanic dataset (`train.csv`) to understand its structure, summary statistics, and distributions of variables.
- Visualize relationships between features and survival using charts and graphs.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Cleanse the dataset by handling missing values.
- Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features.
- Perform feature engineering to create new features or transform existing ones.

### 3. Model Building
- Train several machine learning models using the preprocessed dataset.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and techniques such as cross-validation.

### 4. Model Evaluation and Selection
- Compare the performance of different models.
- Select the best-performing one based on evaluation metrics.

### 5. Model Deployment
- Deploy the selected model for predicting survival probabilities of passengers.
- This can be done through a web application, API, or any other suitable method.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the project locally)
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn (install via pip or conda)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```cmd
   git https://github.com/SSinchana66/Titanic_Classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```cmd
   cd titanic-classification
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```cmd
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. In the web browser that opens, navigate to and open the `Titanic Classification.ipynb` notebook to execute the project code.

## Credits

- The Titanic dataset used in this project is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
- This project is inspired by various tutorials, articles, and resources available on data science and machine learning.
